# Parallel Task MCP

The **Parallel Task MCP** allows initiating deep research or task groups directly from your favorite LLM client. It can be a great way to get to know Parallelâ€™s different APIs by exploring their capabilities, but can also be used as a way to easily do small experiments while developing production systems using Parallel APIs. Please read [our MCP docs here](https://docs.parallel.ai/integrations/mcp/getting-started) for more details.
